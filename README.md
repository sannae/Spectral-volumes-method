# Spectral-volumes-method
### Introduction
This repository includes my MSc thesis work on the Spectral Volumes method - first proposed by Dr. [Z.J.Wang](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999102970415) - applied to an Inertial Confinement Fusion environment. 
The code is part of a benchmark Matlab reduction used for testing the actual code, which is part of the Los Alamos Plasma Simulations (LAPS) project, property of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, US. 
### Components
* The folder `SV-1D` contains the 1-dimensional reduction of the Spectral Volumes method applied to Euler's non-viscous equations.
